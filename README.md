Simple app, where you can build your own burger. Just add ingredients, login/register to confirm order and see your past orders.
Orders and authentication data are stored in google Firebase.

To use login as a default:
Login: test@test.com
Password: 123456

If you want to register, put sample email (only @ required for validation) and password, that contains atleast 6 characters. Then press Submit and login with newly created account. It will be stored in data base, so you can return to page and signin even few weeks ago.
